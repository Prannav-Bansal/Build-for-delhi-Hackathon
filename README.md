Detect ToolBoxes, FireExtinguishers, and OxygenTanks in synthetic space station environments using a YOLOv8 model.

## üß† Overview
This project was created for the Duality AI - Space Station Hackathon. It uses Ultralytics' YOLOv8 for object detection trained on synthetic data from Falcon Digital Twin.

## üìÅ Project Structure
- `data/`: Training/validation datasets
- `runs/`: YOLOv8 output including metrics, plots, confusion matrix, and weights
- `gradio_app.py`: Python script to launch a Gradio UI for image detection
- `YOLOv8_Space_Object_Detector_Documentation.docx`: Project report
